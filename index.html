				<dt>Symptoms:</dt>
				<dd>During menopause, a woman's body undergoes a number of hormonal changes, particularly a decrease in levels of estrogen and progesterone. These changes can lead to a range of physical and emotional symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes, and sleep disturbances.</dd>
				<dt>Treatments:</dt>
				<dd>Treatment options for menopause vary depending on the severity of symptoms and may include lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management techniques. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is another option, which involves taking medications that contain hormones to replace those that the body no longer produces. Other medications, such as antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs, can also be used to alleviate hot flashes and other symptoms.
It's important for individuals going through menopause to discuss their symptoms with their healthcare provider to explore all available treatment options and to monitor for any potential health risks associated with menopause, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.

            <dd>The causes of neurological conditions can also vary widely, but may include genetic factors, infections, autoimmune disorders and injuries to the brain or nervous system.</dd>
            <dt>Treatments:</dt>
            <dd>Treatment for neurological conditions depends on the specific condition and may include medications to manage symptoms, physical therapy to improve mobility and strength, and surgery to remove tumors or repair damage to the nervous system. In some cases, lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise may also be recommended.

Managing neurological conditions can be complex and may require a team of healthcare professionals, including neurologists, neurosurgeons, and physical therapists. It's important to work closely with healthcare professionals to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected by neurological conditions.
